        <li>A few curry leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional, for extra tanginess)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Rice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse 1 cup of basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Soak the rice in water for 15-20 minutes, then drain and set aside</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Base:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee in a large pan or pressure cooker over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and sauté for a few seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sauté the Aromatics:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the finely chopped onion and green chilies to the pan. Sauté until the onions become translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add Tomatoes and Spices:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the finely chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook until the tomatoes soften and start to break down.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, and salt to taste. Cook the mixture until the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Combine Rice and Water:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the drained rice to the pan and mix gently to coat the rice with the tomato masala.</li>
            <li>Pour in 1/2 cup of water (adjust the amount depending on the rice variety and cooking method) and add a pinch of sugar if desired. Stir well.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If using a pan, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and all the water is absorbed.</li>
            <li>If using a pressure cooker, close the lid and cook on low heat for 2 whistles (or according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Turn off the heat and let the pressure release naturally.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Finish and Garnish:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, gently fluff it with a fork.</li>
            <li>Stir in a few curry leaves if using, and garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice if you prefer extra tanginess.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve Tomato Rice hot, garnished with fried onions or nuts if desired. It pairs well with yogurt, raita, or a simple salad.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
