    <h2>Dosa: The Crispy, Savory South Indian Delight</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a quintessential South Indian dish known for its thin, crispy texture and savory flavor. Made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram), dosas are often served with a variety of accompaniments such as sambar (a spicy lentil stew), coconut chutney, and tomato chutney. Whether enjoyed plain, stuffed with spiced potatoes (masala dosa), or served with a range of fillings, dosa is a versatile and beloved staple in Indian cuisine, celebrated for its delicious taste and satisfying crunch.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparing for Dosa batter</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the Ingredients:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse 1 cup of rice and 1/4 cup of urad dal (and fenugreek seeds, if using) in plenty of water.</li>
            <li>Soak them separately in water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Blend the Batter:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drain the soaked rice and urad dal.</li>
            <li>In a blender or wet grinder, combine the rice and urad dal with enough water to make a smooth batter. The consistency should be slightly thicker than pancake batter.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl, cover, and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or until it has doubled in volume and has a slightly sour aroma.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add Salt:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once fermented, gently stir the batter and add salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making Dosa</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat the Pan:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease the pan with a paper towel dipped in oil or ghee.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Pour the Batter:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan.</li>
            <li>Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a thin, even circle, starting from the center and moving outward in a spiral motion.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Dosa:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.</li>
                <li>Cook until the dosa turns golden brown and crispy, and the edges start to lift from the pan (about 2-3 minutes).</li>
                <li>Flip the dosa if you prefer it crispier, or serve it as is if you like it softer.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the dosa from the pan and serve hot with sambar, coconut chutney, and tomato chutney</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade dosas!</p>
